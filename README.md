# ü©∫ Healthcare Insights Dashboard | Power BI Project

Unlocking the hidden patterns in hospital admissions, diagnoses, treatments, and billing to support **better healthcare decisions, cost optimization,** and **patient outcomes**.

---

## üìå Project Summary

This Power BI project explores a synthetic hospital dataset covering patient demographics, medical conditions, blood types, insurance providers, billing amounts, and more.

With four report pages and a highly interactive dashboard, this analysis identifies at-risk populations, patterns in diagnostic outcomes, and potential insights for hospital operations and policy improvement.

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand patient distributions by age, gender, blood type, and condition
- Analyze diagnostic test outcomes and disease prevalence
- Evaluate hospital workloads and geographic health patterns
- Examine how **insurance type** and **demographics** affect billing
- Explore possible blood-type-linked disease tendencies

---

## üîç Key Insights

### üë• Patient Demographics
- Middle-aged adults (45‚Äì64) form the largest age group in hospital visits
- Majority of patients are **female**, followed by **male**, with **non-binary** as a small but represented group
- Blood type **A+** is the most common

### üè• Hospital & Geographic Patterns
- **Texas** leads in patient concentration
- **Houston Methodist** sees the highest volume of patients
- Admission types are evenly split between **planned**, **urgent**, and **emergency**
- Balanced **patient-to-doctor ratio** of 1.19

### üß¨ Diagnostic Observations
- **55% of test results are abnormal**, suggesting high case complexity
- **Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity** are the top conditions
- Diagnostic trends show condition-specific variations in test outcomes

### üíâ Blood Type and Disease Link

### üè¶ Insurance & Billing
- **Medicare covers only female patients**
- **Cigna** insures all non-binary patients
- **Adolescents** incur highest average treatment costs
- Billing patterns vary by condition and provider
